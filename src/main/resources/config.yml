  #Ideally you want this value to be MUCH LOWER than

  #HKJC mode is an IRL prize money calculation method used by the HKJC
  #Where the LowestTopPlacesPrize is only applied to 1st tier instead of all 1st - 3rd
  #NOT recommended unless you have a large server that buys a LOT of tickets (>50000)
  #MODES: DEFAULT, HKJC
  PrizeCalculationMode: "DEFAULT"
  #Choose carry-over fund calculation mode
